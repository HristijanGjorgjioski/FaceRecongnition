# Face Recognition App

This app is build by help of MERN stack. I have use React for frontend and nodejs for backend. Also I have use MongoDB, Express, Express-Validator, Axios etc..
The app uses 'Clarifai' APIs. One is for detecting faces on the pictures and other is to show something about picture(to recognize things, smiles etc..). 
Also there is authentication in this app. User can create account a then login.
Through building this app I have learned a loot. I have use React Hooks. Half of thee frontend is from one tutorial, but backend and a lot of fronted I 
have build alone with help of google and my knowledge. 

# IMPORTANT

When using app please be patient beacuse APIs is hosted on Heroku for free and therefore it is slow! Thank you!
